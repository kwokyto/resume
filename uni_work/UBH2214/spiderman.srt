1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,830
Spider-Man. The web slinging, friendly, neighbourhood
superhero that we all know and love,

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,208
has always been something Marvel Studios wanted to

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:14,110
bring into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or what we call the MCU.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,275
However, the film rights to Spider-Man belong to Sony Pictures exclusively.

5
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,402
Over the past two decades,

6
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:25,281
all Spider-Man films have been produced and directed by Sony.

7
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:28,358
Yet, after the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2,

8
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:31,500
the Spider-Man franchise began on a different path.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,646
Through the lens of game theory,

10
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:36,157
let’s zoom in on how Spider-Man has swung his way from

11
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:38,710
being a lone superhero saving New York,

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,067
to making his entry into the Avengers and

13
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:44,670
saving the world with other superheroes!

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,526
Before diving into his journey,

15
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:50,970
let’s establish the scope and premise of what we will be talking about today.

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,539
Firstly, we assume that the information found online is true,

17
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,000
since most of this information can only be sourced from leaks

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,280
 instead of official reports.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,900
Next, since merchandising and streaming rights
are independent of film rights,

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,859
we will not consider payoffs from merchandising and streaming deals.

21
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:14,039
Instead, we will solely concentrate on the
payoffs from the movie production deals.

22
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,509
To estimate these payoffs,

23
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,119
we will use the total box office revenue minus the production cost.

24
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,497
With these assumptions in mind,

25
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:25,593
we will explore three different deals between Marvel and Sony,

26
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:28,639
updating this timeline as we move along.

27
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:31,272
For each deal, this is how the game will be played.

28
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:35,637
Marvel wants to use Sony’s Spider-Man and will first make a business pitch,

29
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,602
after which Sony is able to respond.

30
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:42,577
If a deal is struck, Marvel will be allowed to use Spider-Man in their films,

31
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:46,959
and in return, will help produce Spider-Man films for Sony.

32
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,322
But to decide the split between profits of these solo Spider-Man films,

33
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:52,449
Marvel can make three types of pitches:

34
00:01:52,449 --> 00:02:00,249
The weak 5-95 pitch; the medium 25-75 pitch; or the strong 50-50 pitch.

35
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:05,669
These represent the splits in profits between
Marvel and Sony respectively.

36
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:08,650
Sony will then decide whether to accept or reject that offer.

37
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,799
Both players are also allowed to negotiate throughout the process.

38
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:16,569
Now that we have set things straight, let’s begin the journey!

39
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,536
Going back to where it all started,

40
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:21,418
after the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2,

41
00:02:21,418 --> 00:02:24,271
it received tremendous backlash from the audience

42
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:28,007
due its poor storyline and subpar screenwriting.

43
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:32,087
Thus, it was expected that the film did poorly in terms of net profits,

44
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:37,530
and garnered numerous scathing reviews from movie critics and fans alike.

45
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,709
At this stage, let’s revisit our payoff matrix, with the payoffs added in.

46
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,954
To estimate the payoffs of a future Marvel produced Spider-Man movie,

47
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:48,608
we can use the most recent Marvel superhero movie

48
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:52,505
released at the time when The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was still out in theatres,

49
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,944
and that would be Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

50
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:58,260
If Marvel were to propose a weak pitch,

51
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,092
they would get only $27 million in payoffs,

52
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:04,409
while Sony gets the remaining $517 million.

53
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,480
For a medium pitch, Marvel gets $136 million,

54
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,060
and Sony gets $408 million.

55
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,140
Finally, a strong pitch from Marvel would see profits split equally,

56
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,319
with both parties receiving $272 million.

57
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,903
Meanwhile, on Sony’s side,

58
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:26,362
they would anticipate their profits for the 
next Spider-Man film to be $523 million,

59
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:31,807
obtained from averaging the payoffs from
 the two previous Amazing Spider-Man films.

60
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:35,000
Marvel initially proposed a weak pitch to Sony.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,771
This is because Marvel knows that if they
were to pitch more aggressively,

62
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:41,219
Sony will definitely reject them.

63
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,406
The weak pitch was the most viable option

64
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:47,980
since Sony would be rather indifferent to either option.

65
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,000
Even though the payoffs are similar,

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,930
it is evident that Marvel’s deal is much more certain than Sony’s own plans.

67
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,063
Sony’s Spider Man films have been on a 
downtrend trend in terms of revenue,

68
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:03,260
with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 being the lowest ever.

69
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,493
At the same time, Marvel’s superhero films have been performing

70
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:08,570
exceptionally well in the box office.

71
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,241
Thus, we would expect Sony to go with the
safer option

72
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:16,132
and accept the weak pitch that Marvel offered.

73
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:18,456
However, this was not the case.

74
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:21,543
To explain why Sony rejected Marvel’s deal,

75
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:25,569
let’s take a look at Sony’s position on the prospect theory curve.

76
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:29,570
Let’s take The Amazing Spider-Man 1 to be Sony’s initial reference point.

77
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,271
Since The Amazing Spider-Man 2 grossed
lower than The Amazing Spider-Man 1,

78
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:37,474
this means that Sony is in the loss zone.

79
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:41,370
From Sony’s perspective, any incremental gain in monetary payoffs

80
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,179
would give them much more utility, making them more risk seeking.

81
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:50,000
As such, instead of using monetary payoffs in the game matrix,

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,230
let’s revisit the matrix in terms of utility.

83
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,179
Recalling the numbers, the additional $6 million
dollars gained

84
00:04:57,179 --> 00:05:00,607
if Sony rejects the deal would be substantial,

85
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:03,170
now that they are risk-seeking.

86
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,460
In this scenario, even if Sony’s own plans
were more uncertain than Marvel’s offer,

87
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,531
they are unlikely to accept the deal

88
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:14,079
because of the significant difference in utility.

89
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:20,257
Thus, they rejected Marvel’s offer and proceeded
on with their own plans.

90
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:25,267
However, in a dramatic turn of events, Sony’s email servers were hacked,

91
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:28,010
resulting in a huge email leak.

92
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,517
This leak revealed the negotiations between
Marvel and Sony to the general public,

93
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:37,380
and exposed the fact that Sony rejected a seemingly favourable deal.

94
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,820
Given that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was so poorly received,

95
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,010
fans urged Sony to accept Marvel’s offer,

96
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,870
given Marvel’s success with superhero films.

97
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,791
With this, Sony went back to the negotiation table with Marvel.

98
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,000
We now shift our focus to how social pressure

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,120
has affected Sony's decision following the leak.

100
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,577
Now, the game matrix changes in Marvel’s favour.

101
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,586
Sony would want to gain the social approval from fans

102
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:09,410
by accepting Marvel’s offer, because it would give them much more utility.

103
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,077
This additional utility is reflected in the
game matrix

104
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:15,773
across all pitches, if Sony accepts the deal.

105
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:19,488
At this point, if they were to choose to produce the films themselves,

106
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:23,899
the utility would be much lower than if they were to accept Marvel’s offer,

107
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,697
 and it would also be much more uncertain.

108
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:28,262
Given the social pressure,

109
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,969
it is clear that Marvel’s offer is the best choice,

110
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:35,237
both in terms of utility and certainty.

111
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:37,864
To prevent any further loss in profits,

112
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,295
and also potentially losing their fans,

113
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:42,324
 Sony gave in to the social pressure

114
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:45,603
and accepted the deal that Marvel had proposed earlier.

115
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:50,167
According to this deal, Marvel would be allowed
to use Spider-Man in three of the films:

116
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:55,524
Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame.

117
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:59,225
In return, Marvel will help Sony reboot the
Spider-Man series,

118
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:02,913
with Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far from Home.

119
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:05,321
Marvel will also take 5% of the profits,

120
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:08,576
with Sony pocketing the remaining 95%.

121
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:13,071
This time, the films finally broke the downward streak in terms of revenue,

122
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:16,323
receiving praise from critics and fans around the world

123
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:19,555
and redeeming the franchise.

124
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:21,671
After the first deal’s success,

125
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:26,200
fans were excited for a second deal to see more of Spider-Man in the MCU.

126
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,234
Let us look at our game matrix for deal number 2.

127
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:33,342
While the previously mentioned movies were
extremely popular,

128
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:37,203
Sony has also found moderate success in their production of Venom,

129
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:40,780
a movie independent of the MCU setting.

130
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,249
While Venom is technically related to Spider-Man,

131
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:46,231
Spider-Man was not involved in this movie.

132
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:50,401
This makes Venom a good underestimate
of a Sony-produced Spider-Man movie,

133
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:53,181
(if Sony were to reject Marvel’s deal)

134
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:57,620
because Spider-Man is generally more
popular than Venom in the box-office.

135
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,794
Conversely, payoffs from the deal are estimated to be

136
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:04,073
based on profits from Spider-Man: Far From Home,

137
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:08,669
since that is an estimate of how successful a combined effort can be.

138
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:10,000
Just from this table,

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,443
it seems that Sony is incentivised to continue this partnership,

140
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:17,059
as long as Marvel sticks with their original
5-95 pitch,

141
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:22,903
 especially after experiencing Spider-Man’s box-office success.

142
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,131
Recognising Spider-Man’s potential,

143
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:29,425
Marvel proposed to increase their share to a 50/50 split between the studios,

144
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:34,497
with the possibility of extending the deal to other Spider-Man-related films.

145
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,529
Considering the fairness of the deal,

146
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:40,400
Marvel’s proposal for a 50-50 split is reasonable,

147
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,063
 because their involvement in the Spider-Man films

148
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:47,130
was a significant reason that heightened the success of Spider-Man,

149
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,380
bearing in mind that Sony’s Spider-Man films suffered harsh reviews

150
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,142
prior to their collaboration with Marvel.

151
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:58,112
Hence, it seems fair for Marvel to ask for a 50-50 pitch

152
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:03,337
for attributing the success Spider-Man enjoys at this juncture.

153
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:08,544
From Sony’s perspective however, this 50-50 split is not fair.

154
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:12,130
Fairness has to consider the concept of reference
transactions,

155
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,430
which considers the previous deals made.

156
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,647
In this case, given the success of a 5-95
movie deal between Sony and Marvel,

157
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:25,000
Marvel’s deviation from the 5-95 reference 
is perceived  by Sony to be unfair.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,604
Additionally, Sony did not see Marvel as a

159
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:31,166
deserving recipient of 50% of the profits.

160
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,222
While it is undeniable that Marvel had a significant role

161
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:36,319
in making Spider-Man great again,

162
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:39,139
the recent successes that Sony has found in Venom,

163
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:42,152
and the animated Spider-Man film, “Into The Spider-Verse”,

164
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:48,148
has made Sony believe that they too, can create good Spider-Man films.

165
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:52,831
Quoting Tony Vinciquerra, the chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures,

166
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:57,009
"The Marvel people are terrific people, we have great respect for them,

167
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:01,160
but on the other hand, we have some pretty terrific people of our own.

168
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,410
[Marvel’s producer] didn't do all the work

169
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,844
we're pretty capable of doing what we have to do here."

170
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:10,990
While Marvel found the 50-50 split fair,

171
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,442
Sony had a low preference for the 50-50 split

172
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:15,872
due to its perceived inequality.

173
00:10:15,872 --> 00:10:22,031
As a result, Sony and Marvel were unable to
reach a new movie deal for Spider-Man.

174
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:24,214
After Far from Home was released,

175
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:28,452
news revealed that further negotiations between Sony and Marvel broke down,

176
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:33,046
as both couldn't reach a new agreement regarding Spider-Man films.

177
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:35,874
This resulted in a more severe fan backlash

178
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:40,192
because of the inconclusive developments in Spider-Man's storyline.

179
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:42,424
As of Spider-Man: Far From Home,

180
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:45,570
the post-credits scene showed the main villain revealing

181
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,843
Spider-Man's secret identity to the entire world,

182
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:51,958
framing him as a cold-blooded murderer.

183
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,305
If Spider-Man were to leave the MCU,

184
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:57,803
this major cliffhanger might not be properly resolved,

185
00:10:57,803 --> 00:11:01,248
and fans were extremely upset.

186
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:04,813
In fact, fans were so upset, that some even threatened

187
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:07,862
to boycott Sony in retaliation to the news.

188
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:11,657
Since Sony is also big in the gaming industry with the PlayStation,

189
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:15,067
fans started the #BoycottSony on Twitter,

190
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:19,647
asking fellow fans to stop buying the new PS4.

191
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:22,274
This is likely because fans could not understand why

192
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:27,351
the two companies could not put aside their differences for the greater good.

193
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:30,635
Ultimately, the social pressure was so powerful

194
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:33,844
that the fans drove Spider-Man actor, Tom Holland,

195
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:38,920
to convince Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, to renegotiate with Sony,

196
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,951
as seen in this interview.

197
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:47,217
[Bob Iger] And after D23, Tom reached out to folks who worked for me and said

198
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:50,382
“Can I please have Bob’s email address or phone number?”.

199
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:52,715
Of course I am very protected so they were very careful.

200
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:56,328
And I said “Sure, have him contact me.” And he did, we spoke,

201
00:11:56,328 --> 00:12:01,086
and he basically made a… he cried on the phone.
[Jimmy Kimmel] Did he really?

202
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:05,474
[Bob Iger] No, not really. (audience laughs)

203
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:09,469
It was clear that he cared so much and actually we care a lot about him.

204
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:11,167
He’s a great Spider-Man isn’t he?

205
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:16,175
[Jimmy Kimmel] He’s the best Spider-Man! (audience cheers)

206
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:19,351
[Bob Iger] I felt.. I actually... I felt for him

207
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:22,633
and it was clear the fans wanted all of this to happen.

208
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:24,013
So after I got off the phone with him,

209
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:28,407
I made a couple of phone calls to our team at Disney Studios

210
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:31,617
and then I decided to call the head of Sony.

211
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,578
And I said, “We have to get... We got to figure out a way to get this done,

212
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:37,612
for Tom and for the fans.”

213
00:12:37,612 --> 00:12:42,570
This incentivised both companies to continue
their collaboration for Spider-Man films.

214
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,290
We have adjusted the payoff matrix to represent
the incentives from the social pressure,

215
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,000
as reflected by an increase in expected utility

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
for the outcomes where Marvel and Sony successfully make a deal.

217
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,532
The consideration of fairness was critical in helping

218
00:12:57,532 --> 00:13:02,477
Sony and Marvel come to a compromise from their respective pitches.

219
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:04,606
From the augmented payoff matrix,

220
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:08,567
we find that the medium 25-75 split helps to increase

221
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,980
Marvel’s payoff from the previous deal,

222
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,693
while also making the outcome attractive to Sony,

223
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,595
since Sony’s perceived payoff for accepting the deal

224
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,100
now outweighs their payoff for refusing it.

225
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,409
Furthermore, the medium 25-75 split

226
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:25,854
is a nice middle ground between Sony and Marvel’s pitches.

227
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:31,280
Thus, making it a nice focal point between Sony’s preferred 5-95 split,

228
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,375
and Marvel’s preferred 50-50 split.

229
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:38,780
In the end, Marvel and Sony agreed to a 25-75
deal,

230
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,677
which would cover 2 more films:

231
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:45,960
Spider-Man: No Way Home, and a future MCU team-up movie.

232
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,102
Now that we understand how the existing deals came to be,

233
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:53,400
we want to predict how future Marvel - Sony negotiations will go.

234
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,642
If Sony were to allow Marvel to produce
more Spider-Man movies for them,

235
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:59,612
potential payoffs can be estimated

236
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:03,424
by the average of the 3 Spider-Man solo films produced so far.

237
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:05,330
Similarly, without a deal,

238
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:10,223
Sony’s payoff can be estimated by the average of their Venom movies.

239
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:14,495
At first glance, it seems that Sony is likely to accept a deal from Marvel

240
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:17,930
as long as Sony pockets more than half of the profits.

241
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,420
However, we need to reconsider Sony’s outside options.

242
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,696
Ever since The Amazing Spider-Man franchise,

243
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:28,834
Sony had plans to expand their universe around Spider-Man,

244
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,885
to compete with the MCU.

245
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:32,532
In The Amazing Spider-Man 2,

246
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:36,060
Sony teased the introduction of Spider-Man’s biggest villains,

247
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,510
the Sinister Six.

248
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,949
However, plans were cancelled when The Amazing Spider-Man 2

249
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:44,294
failed in the box office.

250
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:48,241
Nevertheless, Sony’s deals with Marvel gave them a second chance,

251
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:51,173
and Sony successfully produced two Venom films,

252
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:54,318
indicating the birth of the Sony Spider-Man Universe,

253
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:56,870
or what we would call the Sony-verse.

254
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,939
Sony’s co-chairman Amy Pascal said in a
report that because of Venom,

255
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:05,029
Sony’s “previously shelved plans” could now come to fruition.

256
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,916
There have also been reports in 2019,

257
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:12,170
that the next seven to eight years of the Sony-verse had been planned.

258
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,470
These include movies like Morbius, Kraven the Hunter,

259
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,670
 The Sinister Six, Nightwatch, Venom 3 and more.

260
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,132
This becomes a new outside option for Sony

261
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:26,640
since the potential payoffs from a Sony-verse is very high.

262
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,310
This means that Sony now can still benefit from a large payoff

263
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,800
even without a deal with Marvel.

264
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,824
If Marvel still wishes to use Spider-Man
and help Sony produce movies,

265
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:39,861
then they would have to give Sony a larger share of the profits

266
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:42,758
so that Sony would not reject the deal again.

267
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:45,880
However, this does not seem to be Marvel’s goal,

268
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,827
as demonstrated in the events of the most recently released

269
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:50,827
Spider-Man: No Way Home.

270
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,809
[Dr. Strange] You’ve got to understand that would mean that everyone

271
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:59,007
 who knows and loves you, we…

272
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:02,738
we'd have no memory of you.

273
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:06,787
 it would be as though you never existed.

274
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,643
[Spider-Man] I know.

275
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:14,134
Do it.

276
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:18,473
This movie essentially becomes a soft reboot for Spider-Man,

277
00:16:18,473 --> 00:16:21,611
because Sony can now utilise him in any way

278
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:25,356
without affecting the storyline flow in the wider MCU.

279
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:27,974
This becomes even better news for Sony

280
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:30,720
because the addition of Spider-Man into the Sony-verse

281
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,089
will only boost the utility that Sony can
get from their outside option.

282
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:38,617
The soft reboot of Spider-Man also indicates that

283
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:42,560
the possibility of massive fan backlash is very low.

284
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,220
The social pressure from fans was a key reason

285
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,834
for the success of the first two deals.

286
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,727
In the first deal, fans were upset because
they wanted to see Spider-Man in the MCU

287
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:55,720
and face off with popular superheroes.

288
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,500
In the second deal, fans were upset because
Spider-Man’s storyline was incomplete

289
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,956
and left on a cliff-hanger that cannot be resolved

290
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,286
if Spider-Man leaves the MCU.

291
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:08,115
However, as of Spider-Man: No Way Home,

292
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:12,370
the origin story for Spider-Man has now been satisfactorily concluded.

293
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,912
Additionally, because of how No Way Home leaves
Spider-Man,

294
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:19,194
he can now be in his own stories without involvement of

295
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:23,019
major Marvel superheroes like Dr. Strange or Captain America.

296
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,412
Given Sony’s enticing outside option,

297
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,191
and the lack of social pressure from fans,

298
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:34,669
we predict that another deal of the same kind
between Marvel and Sony is highly unlikely,

299
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,330
and this makes sense.

300
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,156
Sony no longer needs to rely on Marvel’s production team,

301
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:42,948
or the MCU, to develop Spider-Man’s future stories,

302
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:46,010
and the fans would still remain satisfied.

303
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,210
However, this does not mean that Spider-Man
would exit the MCU.

304
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,388
In a report, Tom Holland has said that the new agreement

305
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:57,820
between Sony and Marvel would be that it is an open conversation.

306
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,267
Should Marvel want him to appear in another of their movies,

307
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:05,659
it would not be the same five-film deal or two-film deal as before.

308
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:10,267
Therefore, we speculate that if Marvel
wants to use Spider-Man in future films,

309
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:14,297
they will still approach Sony, but with a deal of a different nature.

310
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:17,760
Since Marvel no longer has a stake in Spider-Man solo films,

311
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,690
there is no more profit to split between the two companies.

312
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,966
Instead, we think that the new deal

313
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:26,662
would mainly be an exchange of characters.

314
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:29,409
In fact, this is what they have been doing.

315
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,988
As explained by Sony Pictures’ chairman, Tom Rothman,

316
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:37,574
while Sony lends Spider-Man in Marvel movies, Marvel allows characters like

317
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:43,113
Iron Man and Dr. Strange to appear in Sony’s
(Spider-Man) Homecoming and No Way Home.

318
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:45,952
Therefore, if Marvel wants to use Spider-Man,

319
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:49,115
and is willing to lend other characters to Sony,

320
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:54,570
it is extremely likely that Sony would cooperate and create a new deal.

321
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,092
To recap, we have used various game theory concepts

322
00:18:58,092 --> 00:19:02,056
to explain the deals that revived Spider-Man in movies,

323
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:06,779
as well as predict the future of Spider-Man in superhero films.

324
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,000
We learnt that there is a common factor among the deals,

325
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,645
and we believe that this is the moral of the story here.

326
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:15,876
When dealing with film franchises,

327
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:18,789
we might think that profit is all there is,

328
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,919
and that is partially true.

329
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,540
However, while decision making is based on profit,

330
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,971
it is also strongly influenced by the audience,

331
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:32,820
because there is a large social pressure from fans all over the world.

332
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,661
Both Marvel and Sony are large companies with power,

333
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:40,680
and with great power, there must also come great responsibility,

334
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,118
and that responsibility is to us fans.
