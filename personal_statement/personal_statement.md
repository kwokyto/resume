## About Me

My passion in cybersecurity sparked from watching the television series Mr. Robot, which followed a cybersecurity engineer who is a vigilante hacker by night. I was fascinated by Mr. Robot’s technical (and psychological) accuracy in every hacking scene, down to the social engineering techniques and the tools used. This gave me a deeper appreciation for cybersecurity and jumpstarted my journey in the cybersecurity world. As a diligent and self-motivated learner, my passion in cybersecurity had not only led me to pick up coding skills, but also to attend several technical courses to build my skills in cybersecurity, all before officially pursuing my honours degree.

Outside of my career, I absolutely love water sports, having been a sailor since young. I started in the junior Optimist class when I was 8 and evolved to sail larger classes like the ILCA. I believe that my sailing hobby reflects my adventurous and “willing-to-try-new-things” attitude. Even though I have retired from competitive sailing for over 6 years now, I am still pushing myself to explore new variants of sailing. In fact, I am currently training to be proficient in kitesurfing and windsurfing, both being thrill-seeking sports. This attitude also shows in the work that I do, where I tend to try unconventional means in presentation, products, or method, so as to stand out from the rest.

## Internship Objectives

Being a student in technology, I must admit that I lack the business awareness that is essential to kickstart any wild ideas that I have. Just last semester, I had plans to set up a small lunch café in my residential college that fell through when I could not figure out how to manage costs. Hence, I would like to understand all the financial know-how and risk management skills to convert an idea into a future start-up.

I also aim to gain some leadership skills, especially when trying to prioritise team welfare without falling short on practical objectives. I believe that working in a start-up can teach me to become a more effective leader that people are willing to respect and follow.

Ultimately, with the cybersecurity industry in its relative infancy in Singapore, I wish to use these non-technical skills to understand the practical decisions that companies have to make when dealing with cybersecurity. Such insights are necessary to inform any potential solutions and policies that can be implemented to build a truly resilient Singapore.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

I was recruited into the Singapore’s Optimist National Sailing Team at an early age of 11 till 15. Rigorous and strict trainings to perform at international standards developed in me discipline, independence, and perseverance which I carry with myself until today. This means that I always strive to produce the best work in everything that I do and will never quit until I reach that standard for myself.

However, I have to admit that this overzealous attitude has often blinded me to my own capacities. In my previous internship, I was unable to effectively maintain a healthy work-life balance, which resulted in me burning out early in the internship. Fortunately, I learnt how to proactively section out my time, and deliberately allocating time to self-care activities such as my sailing hobbies, binging a TV series, or even just sleeping. Nevertheless, this is an active work in progress, and being more aware has reminded me to prioritise my mental health.

## Unique Skill Sets

On top of my degree, I am also undertaking the University Scholars Programme, which is a  multidisciplinary academic programme that allows me to make cross-discipline connections beyond computing. I often pride myself in being able to see things from different perspectives and give a holistic response that considers all points of view. With that, I am able to appreciate the different threads in life that may seem irrelevant but play a significant role in technology. Such topics that I have explored include philosophy, psychology, data presentation, self-help techniques, and religion.
