## Queuing Bot

A queue system on Telegram

This Telegram bot was created for the photo booth during the Start of Semester 2 Dinner 2021. It allows users to join the queue, while giving admins the ease of managing late and missing users. It was very well received and was subsequently adapted for use during the End of Semester 2 Dinner 2021. This was coded in Python.
