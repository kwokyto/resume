## Chilling Sessions

Chilling Sessions was a ground up initiative that I orchestrated and directed as part of the Love, USP EXCO team. The goal of this GUI is to remind USP students to take a break from work to improve their mental health, and educate them on other unorthodox methods of relaxing. In this week-long event, I coordinated 5 separate collaborations with various student-led groups to conduct several activities with the focus of relaxing to improve mental health.

This initiative was awarded a special $1000 welfare fund by the Residential Life Section of the NUS Office of Student Affairs (OSA) to support the costs of executing this event. Additionally, the event's success resulted it to be featured in a [NUS Residential Life article](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/reslife/2021/11/03/how-to-take-care-of-your-mental-health-tips-from-mental-wellness-groups-on-campus/).

## A Safe Space

An anonymous Telegram group chat

A Safe Space was created as a platform for USP students to hold conversations on mental health issues. This Telegram bot simulates a group chat where students can share experience or advice, while remaining completely anonymous. When registered, any message that the student send to the bot will be sent to all other students that are also registered on the bot. The student's message would be accompanied by their username, allowing others to identify messages that are sent. No other personal information would be shared with anyone in the group.

This version is currently live within the USP community, with private and secure conversations happening weekly.

## USP Queue Bot

A queue system on Telegram

The initial version of this Telegram bot was created for the photo booth during the Start of Semester 2 Dinner 2021. It allows users to join the queue, while giving admins the ease of managing late and missing users. It was very well received and was subsequently adapted for use during the End of Semester 2 Dinner 2021. This was coded in Python.

A new, currently live, version of the bot was created with additional features inspired from the original. Now, all notifications to users in the queue are automatic, and the queue now operates with a more efficient "bump" system. Although this new version was created for a Ground Up Initiative, the event was ultimately cancelled due to Covid19 restrictions. This new version was then used during the End of Semester 1 Dinner 2021.

## Build On, Singapore 2020 Hackathon

In this hackathon, my team achieved [Semi-Finalist](./build_on_singapore/build_on_singapore_certificate.pdf) by developing "Reliability Bot". It was a Telegram bot that aimed to automate the process of determining how reliable a piece of information was, based on the government's recommendations. Afterwards, it would return a recommendation that is accompanied by reasoning to educate users on how to determine reliability in other pieces of information. The bot scores texts based on three criteria: literacy, sentiments, and Google Search corroboration.

This project involved the use of AWS solutions, and I was in charge of developing the natural language processing function of the bot. This was done using AWS Comprehend, and coded in Python. The video to our product pitch can be seen [here](build_on_singapore/build_on_singapore_video.mp4).

## Sailing Race Officer Guide

To assist in race management

I had created this application to help with race management when I initially started out as a National Race Officer. It contains an axis calculator, as well as a countdown timer customised to sailing requirements. This was coded in React Native.
